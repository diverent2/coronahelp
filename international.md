## Introduction

For the last couple months and especially days there was only one topic worldwide: `Covid-19` also know as the Corona-Virus.
And that's for a good reason:  
We are facing an upresidented global health criris right now.

### What you can do right away

**But there are also good news**

You can do something about this **RIGHT NOW**.

1. Get informed if not already and inform others who underestimate the problem.

> ⚠️ ALWAYS check the sources of the things you share!
> One of the worse things that could happen right now is spreading `fake news` and therefore panic.

2. Wash your hands and keep distance to others to [#flattenTheCurve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/).

If we all work together, we can get through this!

## Link collection

People all over the world do their best to contribute to solve this problem. Which contributes to a new problem:  
The amount of information is completely overwhealing and helpful resources get lost in all the traffic and misinformation.

This page aims to collect useful resources to spread awareness (and not the virus!), build support systems and more.

### Informational material

One of the most important steps to do is to spread awareness.
We can do this by not just telling people about the problem but by providing them formal education.

> Don't spread panic but awareness and understading
